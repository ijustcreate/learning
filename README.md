trying to create vr worlds

Hello, 

I am felix embree. I am alwasy looking for people to colaborate with! Feel free to reach out here or via facebook.

I want to make worlds.
I want to make those worlds places that I and others can interact with.

I want to learn more about Neural Networks.
I want to run simulations.

I want to encorperate the tutorials of Sebastian Lague into my unity project. Ideally from a vr observer perspective.
with abilities to speed time and walk between realities/simulations.

I want to create a vr world where I can set up puzzles and experiences for people. 

I want to create alterante magical worlds
that are endless sandboxes.

sure. that's good for now.
